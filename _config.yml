  I developed my interest in data science right after the Covid pandemic, I was amazed by that what insights we can get from the data and 
  we can actually predict where the virus is spreading, how it is mutating and its effect on economies. Fascinating! I feel so excited and
  started to learn everything I can because I have to, python, SQL, statistics, exploratory analysis, machine learning, neural networks...

  I obtained a Data Scientist Nanodegree, a Machine Learning Engineer certificate, and a Deep Learning certificate from Udacity, 
  I am currently working as Sr Strategy Analyst in a Auto Financial company and making data driven decisions everyday.
