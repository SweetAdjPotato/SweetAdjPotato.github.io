  I developed my interest in data science right after the Covid pandemic, I was amazed by that what insights we can get from the data and 
  we can actually predict where the virus is spreading, how it is mutating and its effect on economies. Fascinating! I feel so excited and
  started to learn everything I can because I have to, python, SQL, statistics, exploratory analysis, machine learning, neural networks...

  I obtained a Data Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer certificate from Udacity, I am currently diving in deep learning 
  and sharpening my skills everyday.
