  I developed my interest in data science right after the pandemic, I was amazed that we can actually predict where the virus is spreading, 
  how it is mutating and its effect on economies. Fascinating! I feel so excited and started to learn everything, python, SQL, statistics, exploratory analysis, machine learning, neural networks...

  I obtained a Data Scientist Nanodegree, a Machine Learning Engineer certificate, and a Deep Learning certificate from Udacity gradually, 
  I am currently working as a Sr Strategy Analyst in an auto financing company and making data driven decisions everyday.
